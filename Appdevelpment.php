        <p >You might develop two native applications. Taking advantage of native APIs and OS-specific programming languages can help you build a powerful app.
            Most enterprise apps, especially ones that require substantial application programming interface (API) traffic, benefit from native development.

        If you decide to develop native applications one at a time, you’ll likely want to begin with Android, for some of the same reasons that independent app developers often focus on Android. You’ll probably have better luck developing the full application as an MVP on Android and then converting and optimizing it to iOS after release.

            mobile application development works best for simple web applications, three- or four-page mobile applications with limited functions.
