        <p style="margin: 20px;">The initial phase of developing software is obtaining requirements. product developers collaborate with
            stakeholders, such 
            as end users and business owners, at this stage to determine the needs of the product. In
            order to suit the expectations of its users, the programme must have some essential features and
            functionalities.
            The software development team begins the design phase after determining the requirements. The group develops a
            blueprint for the software at this stage, which includes the overall architecture, user interface, and database
            schema. For the programme to be scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly, the design step is essential.

            <p>The process of creating websites and web applications using various programming languages, frameworks,
                and technologies to deliver content over the internet.Web development refers to the creating, building,
                and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming,
                and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e.
                websites.Web Development can be classified into Frontend Development & Backend Development. The part of
                a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the
                ‘client side’ of the application. The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as
                front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application. Web development is closely
                related to the job of designing the features and functionality of websites and apps (often called “web
                design”), but the “web development” term is usually reserved for the actual construction .</p>

        <p style="padding: 10px;">The real software is developed during the coding stage. The software is coded by Gathering needs: This phase
            entails gathering and analyzing the software's needs, which include features, functionality, and performance.
            Working with stakeholders such as end-users, managers, and other relevant parties is common when obtaining
            requirements.<br></br>
    
            program architects and designers construct a plan for how the program will be built during the design phase,
            which includes the general structure, user interface design, and technical specifications. Designers can develop
            visual representations of software using a variety of tools and approaches, such as wireframes, mockups, and
            prototypes.<br></br>
            Implementation: During the implementation phase, developers write the software's real code. This covers the
            creation of individual modules or components, their integration, and the testing of the overall system. To
            implement the software, developers may utilize a range of programming languages, frameworks, and tools.<br></br>
    
            Testing: After developing the program, it must be carefully tested to ensure that it fits the requirements and
            functions as expected. Functional testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing are all included.
            Testing is normally carried out by a dedicated team of testers who may employ both automated and manual testing
            methods.<br></br>
    
    
            Deployment: Once the software has been tested and declared ready for release, it is put into production. This
            may entail putting software on servers and configuring them.</p>
